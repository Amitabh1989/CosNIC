Thanks for all your help. I now want to do the below. 

I want to trigger test on remote machines. For which i intend to do the following.
1. Take user input for machine IPs and credentials.
2. Take test cases input in the config file. (This we have already coded as you are aware)
3. Now, I want to keep a copy of the code somewhere in the django server. And once user inputs are done. I copy peer to peer, the files in a pre destained location on machines input provided by the user. 
4. Start the test and then keep monitoring the test progress.
5. Test runs and updates the user run results. 
6. User can log back in anytime and understand what the test progerss, results are. 
How can we?



To achieve this workflow with Django, you'll need to combine several technologies and strategies. Here's a high-level approach to implement each step:

### **1. Take User Input for Machine IPs and Credentials**
   - **Forms & Models**: Create a form and corresponding model to capture the IPs and credentials of the remote machines.
   - **Encryption**: Store the credentials securely by encrypting them in the database.

   ```python
   from django import forms
   from django.db import models
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

   class RemoteMachine(models.Model):
       ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
       username = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       password = models.BinaryField()  # Store encrypted password

       def set_password(self, raw_password):
           cipher_suite = Fernet(settings.SECRET_KEY)
           self.password = cipher_suite.encrypt(raw_password.encode())

       def get_password(self):
           cipher_suite = Fernet(settings.SECRET_KEY)
           return cipher_suite.decrypt(self.password).decode()

   class RemoteMachineForm(forms.ModelForm):
       class Meta:
           model = RemoteMachine
           fields = ['ip_address', 'username', 'password']
   ```

### **2. Take Test Cases Input in the Config File**
   - **Done already**: As you've mentioned, this step is already implemented.

### **3. Copy Code to Remote Machines**
   - **Fabric/Paramiko**: Use Fabric or Paramiko to handle SSH connections and file transfers to the remote machines.

   ```python
   from fabric import Connection

   def copy_files_to_remote(ip, username, password, local_path, remote_path):
       with Connection(host=ip, user=username, connect_kwargs={"password": password}) as c:
           c.put(local_path, remote=remote_path)
   ```

### **4. Start the Test and Monitor Progress**
   - **Background Tasks**: Use `Celery` for running the test asynchronously in the background.
   - **Log Streaming**: Implement a WebSocket or long-polling solution to stream the test progress back to the frontend in real-time.

   ```python
   from celery import shared_task

   @shared_task
   def run_test_on_remote(ip, username, password, test_command):
       with Connection(host=ip, user=username, connect_kwargs={"password": password}) as c:
           result = c.run(test_command)
           return result.stdout

   # You can start the task like this:
   task = run_test_on_remote.delay(ip, username, password, 'bash run_tests.sh')
   ```

### **5. Update and Store Test Results**
   - **Database Storage**: Capture the output of the tests and store the results in the database for later retrieval.
   - **Model Example**:
   
   ```python
   class TestRun(models.Model):
       remote_machine = models.ForeignKey(RemoteMachine, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       start_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
       end_time = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
       status = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       result = models.TextField()

       def update_status(self, new_status):
           self.status = new_status
           self.save()
   ```

### **6. User Interface for Monitoring and Results**
   - **Frontend**: Develop views to display test progress and results. You could use Django views, DRF for APIs, and JavaScript (React) for real-time updates.
   - **WebSocket**: For real-time updates, implement WebSocket with Django Channels or use Django SignalR.

### **Flow Summary:**
1. **User Input**: Capture IPs, credentials, and test cases.
2. **File Transfer**: Copy the necessary code and config files to the remote machines.
3. **Test Execution**: Run tests on remote machines asynchronously.
4. **Monitoring**: Stream logs and progress in real-time.
5. **Results Storage**: Store and display test results, accessible anytime.

### **Tools & Libraries:**
- **Fabric/Paramiko**: For SSH and file transfers.
- **Celery**: For background task processing.
- **Django Channels/SignalR**: For real-time updates.
- **Redis/RabbitMQ**: As a message broker for Celery.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: As your Django database for storing test runs and results.

This setup will provide you with a robust system for triggering, monitoring, and managing tests on remote machines directly from your Django application.
