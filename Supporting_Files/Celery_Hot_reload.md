When you make changes to a Celery task, you need to restart the Celery worker because the worker loads the task definitions into memory when it starts. Any updates to the task code are not reflected in the running worker because it’s still using the old code in memory. To apply the changes, the worker needs to be restarted.

### Why Restart is Required:
1. **Task Definition Loaded into Memory:** When a Celery worker starts, it loads all task definitions into its memory. Any change you make to a task will not be recognized until the worker reloads those tasks, which happens only on restart.

2. **No Native Hot Reloading:** Celery workers do not have a native hot-reloading mechanism like Django’s development server.

### How to Achieve Hot Reloading:
While Celery doesn’t have built-in support for hot reloading, you can achieve a similar effect using external tools:

#### 1. **Use `watchdog` with Celery:**
   The `watchdog` Python package can monitor changes in your task files and automatically restart the Celery worker when changes are detected.

   - Install `watchdog`:
     ```bash
     pip install watchdog
     ```

   - Create a script to monitor your task files and restart the Celery worker:
     ```python
     from watchdog.observers import Observer
     from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
     import os
     import subprocess
     import time

     class RestartCeleryOnChange(FileSystemEventHandler):
         def __init__(self, celery_command):
             self.celery_command = celery_command
             self.process = subprocess.Popen(self.celery_command, shell=True)

         def on_modified(self, event):
             if event.src_path.endswith('.py'):
                 print(f"{event.src_path} changed. Restarting Celery...")
                 self.process.terminate()
                 self.process = subprocess.Popen(self.celery_command, shell=True)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         celery_command = "celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info"
         event_handler = RestartCeleryOnChange(celery_command)
         observer = Observer()
         observer.schedule(event_handler, path='path_to_your_tasks_directory', recursive=True)
         observer.start()

         try:
             while True:
                 time.sleep(1)
         except KeyboardInterrupt:
             observer.stop()
         observer.join()
     ```

   - Replace `"your_project"` with your actual Celery app name and update `"path_to_your_tasks_directory"` to point to where your tasks are defined.

   - Run this script, and it will monitor your task files and restart Celery automatically whenever you make a change.

#### 2. **Use Docker with `--restart` Policy (if applicable):**
   If you are running Celery in Docker, you can use Docker’s `--restart` policy combined with `docker-compose` to handle automatic restarts. This won't be true hot reloading but can simplify the process of restarting workers after changes.

   In your `docker-compose.yml`, you can set up your Celery service like this:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     celery_worker:
       build: .
       command: celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       restart: always
   ```

   This will automatically restart the worker if it stops (e.g., after you manually restart it via the monitoring solution above).

#### 3. **Development Environment Consideration:**
   In development, you can use a simpler setup with the `watchdog` solution. However, for production, automatic restarts might not always be desirable. For production, carefully consider the implications of automatically restarting workers and use a more controlled deployment strategy.

### Conclusion:
Celery doesn’t support hot reloading natively, so you need to restart the worker to reflect changes in your task code. You can implement a hot-reload-like feature using tools like `watchdog`, which automatically restarts the worker upon detecting changes in your task files.
