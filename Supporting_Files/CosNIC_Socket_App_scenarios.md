### Additional Use Cases for WebSockets
1. **Real-Time Alerts**: Notify users instantly about critical issues or test failures as they happen.
2. **Interactive Dashboards**: Update dashboards with live data without requiring page refreshes.
3. **Collaborative Log Viewing**: Allow multiple users to view and discuss logs in real-time.
4. **Customizable Notifications**: Let users set up alerts based on specific log events or patterns.
5. **Progress Tracking**: Show real-time progress updates for long-running test cases or jobs.
6. **Historical Data Analysis**: Integrate real-time logs with historical data to provide insights or trends.
7. **Permission-Based Access**: Control who can view or interact with live logs based on user roles or permissions.
8. **Performance Metrics**: Stream performance metrics or system health data live to users.
9. **Live Log Filtering**: Allow users to filter logs in real-time based on criteria or keywords.
10. **Integration with Other Tools**: Enable WebSocket communication with other tools or systems for a unified monitoring experience.

### Implementation Notes
- **WebSocket Connections**: Ensure efficient handling of WebSocket connections and scalability to support multiple users.
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization to control access to live logs.
- **Performance**: Optimize performance to handle large volumes of log data and frequent updates.

If youâ€™re focusing on live logs and real-time updates, a dedicated app for this makes sense. It keeps the functionality separate and manageable while allowing for expansion into other real-time features in the future.
