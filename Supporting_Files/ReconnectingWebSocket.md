Yes, you're absolutely right! You can absolutely maintain a **persistent WebSocket connection** by implementing a **reconnecting WebSocket**. This is commonly used in applications that require real-time updates, such as live sports broadcasts, stock market updates, or any live data streaming, where disconnections might occur due to network issues or page refreshes.

### How Reconnecting WebSockets Work:
1. **Automatic Reconnection**: When the WebSocket connection drops (due to a network failure or page refresh), you can implement logic to attempt reconnection after a short delay.
2. **Retry Logic**: You can use exponential backoff or set a fixed interval between reconnection attempts.
3. **Event Handling**: You can listen for WebSocket events like `onclose` and `onerror` to trigger the reconnection attempts.
4. **Fallbacks**: If reconnection repeatedly fails, you can notify the user or retry until a connection is re-established.

### Simple Implementation Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
class ReconnectingWebSocket {
    constructor(url) {
        this.url = url;
        this.ws = null;
        this.reconnectDelay = 1000;  // Start with 1 second delay
        this.maxReconnectDelay = 10000;  // Maximum delay before retrying
        this.connect();  // Initiate the connection
    }

    connect() {
        this.ws = new WebSocket(this.url);

        this.ws.onopen = () => {
            console.log("WebSocket connected!");
            // Reset reconnect delay upon successful connection
            this.reconnectDelay = 1000;
        };

        this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            console.log("Received message:", event.data);
        };

        this.ws.onclose = () => {
            console.log("WebSocket closed. Trying to reconnect...");
            this.reconnect();  // Try reconnecting on close
        };

        this.ws.onerror = (error) => {
            console.log("WebSocket error:", error);
            this.ws.close();  // Close the connection on error
        };
    }

    reconnect() {
        // Exponential backoff for reconnect attempts
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`Reconnecting in ${this.reconnectDelay / 1000} seconds...`);
            this.connect();
            this.reconnectDelay = Math.min(this.reconnectDelay * 2, this.maxReconnectDelay);  // Increase delay exponentially
        }, this.reconnectDelay);
    }

    send(data) {
        if (this.ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
            this.ws.send(data);
        } else {
            console.log("WebSocket is not open. Message not sent.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const ws = new ReconnectingWebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");
```

### Key Features:
- **Auto Reconnect**: When the WebSocket closes (`onclose`), it triggers a reconnection attempt after a delay.
- **Exponential Backoff**: The delay between reconnection attempts increases exponentially up to a defined maximum, helping to avoid overloading the server during continuous failures.
- **Retry on Errors**: If an error occurs, it closes the connection and tries to reconnect.
- **Reconnect After Page Refresh**: Even after a page refresh or accidental disconnect, the WebSocket will automatically attempt to reconnect.

### How to Use It:
- This pattern is widely used in **real-time applications** where you need a stable connection. For example:
  - **Live matches**: Where you want continuous real-time updates even in case of temporary network issues.
  - **Chat applications**: Where the user needs to stay connected to receive messages.
  - **Real-time monitoring**: Like server logs, test run progress (in your case), or stock trading data.

### Improvements:
1. **Custom Retry Policies**: You can improve this by customizing the retry intervals or retry attempts (e.g., stop retrying after a certain number of failures).
2. **Notification to the User**: Optionally, notify the user when the connection is lost and when it successfully reconnects.

This pattern ensures that your WebSocket connection remains persistent and reliable, even in the face of connectivity issues or other disruptions.
