If logs are still being displayed only at the end of the script execution, it's likely that the `subprocess` or Python's I/O buffering is causing the delay. Here are some additional strategies to ensure that logs are streamed live:

### 1. **Force Flushing in the Script:**
   Ensure that the script being run flushes its output immediately. If you're using `print` statements in the script, you can modify them to flush:

   ```python
   print("Log message", flush=True)
   ```

   If you can't modify the script directly, you can run the script with the `-u` flag, which forces stdin, stdout, and stderr to be unbuffered:

   ```python
   process = subprocess.Popen(
       [sys.executable, "-u", script_path],
       stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
       stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
       text=True,
       bufsize=1  # Line-buffering
   )
   ```

### 2. **Use `pty` (Pseudo-Terminal) in UNIX Systems:**
   If you're running this on a UNIX-like system (Linux or macOS), you can use the `pty` module to create a pseudo-terminal, which can help with real-time log streaming by forcing line-by-line output:

   ```python
   import pty
   import os
   import asyncio

   async def send_logs_to_websocket(consumer, script_path):
       def read(fd):
           data = os.read(fd, 1024).decode()
           return data

       # Create a pseudo-terminal
       master, slave = pty.openpty()
       process = subprocess.Popen(
           [sys.executable, script_path],
           stdout=slave,
           stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
           text=True,
           bufsize=1,
           close_fds=True
       )
       os.close(slave)

       while True:
           output = read(master)
           if output:
               await consumer.send({
                   "type": "websocket.send",
                   "text": output.strip()
               })
               print(output, end="")  # Optional: Also print to the server console
           if process.poll() is not None:
               break

       os.close(master)
       process.wait()
   ```

### 3. **Use `asyncio.subprocess` for Asynchronous Handling:**
   You can use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for better handling of asynchronous operations:

   ```python
   import asyncio

   async def send_logs_to_websocket(consumer, script_path):
       process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
           sys.executable, "-u", script_path,
           stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
           stderr=asyncio.subprocess.STDOUT
       )

       while True:
           line = await process.stdout.readline()
           if line:
               await consumer.send({
                   "type": "websocket.send",
                   "text": line.decode().strip()
               })
               print(line.decode(), end="")  # Optional: Also print to the server console
           else:
               break

       await process.wait()
   ```

### 4. **Client-Side Logging:**
   Ensure the client-side code appends each line instead of replacing the content:

   ```javascript
   ws.onmessage = function(event) {
       console.log('Raw message from server onmessage:', event.data);
       document.getElementById('ct').innerText += event.data + "\n";
   };
   ```

### 5. **Verify the Environment:**
   If you're running in a development environment (e.g., Djangoâ€™s runserver), it might not be optimized for handling real-time operations. Consider testing this in a more production-like environment.

### Final Thoughts:
The key to getting real-time logs is ensuring that the script's output is flushed immediately and that the `subprocess` correctly forwards this output to your WebSocket. The above strategies should help ensure that logs are streamed live to your client. If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your environment or the script being executed.
