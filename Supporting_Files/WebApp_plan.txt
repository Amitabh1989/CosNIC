Here me out now. I want to code a django based app that does the below.

Put togther : It runs test cases and informs users about its logs and results.



From the web app, user inputs are as below:

1. Select test cases, suites to run

2. Input machine details, where to run test

3. Populate a few other options related to testing.



Now, web app takes over.

1. If the files are not available in the remote machine : Copies files (around 1GB files to) destination machines given by the user.

2. Copies the config files entered buy the user on the remote machine.

3. Starts the test on those machines and then those machines update the results back to the djnago server. 

4. User can then look at the logs, results, progress of the test. 



Now remember, these destination machines will be windows from where the test will be triggered.

The other 2 machines will be linux where these test will be actually executed.



My intention is to replace the need of a seperate machine to trigger these tests. So when ever a user wants to start a test, I want to create something virtual in the machine managed by server and then just deal with running tests on the remote 2 linux servers. User should not need any 3rd machine to run those tests. How can i?
