Yes, it’s a great idea to create separate WebSocket **channels** for each virtual environment (venv) when multiple test cases are running simultaneously. This approach offers several advantages and can be implemented effectively. Here’s how it could work, including the shareable link concept:

### How This Works:
1. **Separate Channels for Each Venv**:
   - When a user runs multiple test cases across different venvs, you can create a dedicated WebSocket channel for each venv.
   - Each venv would send logs to its own channel. Users can subscribe to whichever venv’s logs they want to follow in real time.

2. **User Subscription**:
   - Users can subscribe to one or more channels depending on which venv logs they’re interested in.
   - This keeps logs organized, allowing users to focus on the logs that matter to them, without getting overwhelmed by logs from other venvs or tests.

3. **Shareable Links for Live Logs**:
   - You can generate **unique shareable links** that allow users to watch the live logs of specific venvs.
   - These links could embed the WebSocket connection with the correct venv channel, so users don’t have to manually subscribe.

### Why This Approach is Good:
- **Scalability**: As more venvs are created, each with its own test cases, separating logs by channels keeps everything organized.
- **User Flexibility**: Users can decide which venv logs they want to view. This is especially useful when multiple tests are running simultaneously.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Users watching the logs via the shareable link get real-time updates without needing access to the entire system.
  
### Example Flow for Multiple Venvs:

1. **Create a Channel for Each Venv**:
   - When a test case is run in a specific venv, a WebSocket channel is opened for that venv.

2. **Generate Shareable Link**:
   - When the test is initiated, a **shareable link** is created for the venv’s logs. The link would point to a specific channel (e.g., `ws://localhost:6789/venv1` for the venv1 logs).

3. **User Subscribes via Link**:
   - Users click on the shareable link to view the logs from that specific venv. They are automatically connected to the WebSocket channel for that venv’s logs.

### Example Implementation:
#### 1. WebSocket Server Handling Multiple Venv Channels:
```python
import logging
import asyncio
import websockets

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
channels = {}

async def log_to_websocket(websocket, path):
    # Extract venv channel from the path (e.g., venv1)
    venv_channel = path.strip('/')
    
    if venv_channel not in channels:
        channels[venv_channel] = []
    channels[venv_channel].append(websocket)
    
    logging.info(f"Client subscribed to {venv_channel} channel")
    
    try:
        while True:
            # Simulate log message from venv
            message = f"Log from {venv_channel} channel"
            for ws in channels[venv_channel]:
                await ws.send(message)
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except websockets.ConnectionClosed:
        logging.info(f"Client disconnected from {venv_channel}")
        channels[venv_channel].remove(websocket)

async def start_server():
    server = await websockets.serve(log_to_websocket, "localhost", 6789)
    await server.wait_closed()

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server())
```

#### 2. Python Script Sending Logs to a Specific Venv Channel:
Each venv sends its logs to its own WebSocket channel (e.g., `ws://localhost:6789/venv1` for venv1 logs).

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def send_logs_to_channel(venv_channel):
    uri = f"ws://localhost:6789/{venv_channel}"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        while True:
            log_message = f"Log message from {venv_channel}"
            await websocket.send(log_message)
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

# For example, for "venv1" channel
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(send_logs_to_channel("venv1"))
```

#### 3. HTML Client Subscribing to Logs from a Specific Venv:
Each user can subscribe to the logs from a specific venv using the shareable link (e.g., `ws://localhost:6789/venv1`).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Live Venv Logs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Live Logs:</h1>
    <ul id="log-list"></ul>

    <script>
        const logList = document.getElementById('log-list');
        const venvChannel = 'venv1';  // Example venv channel

        // Connect to the specific venv WebSocket channel
        const socket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:6789/${venvChannel}`);

        // Listen for log messages
        socket.onmessage = function(event) {
            const logItem = document.createElement('li');
            logItem.textContent = event.data;
            logList.appendChild(logItem);
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Generating Shareable Links:
For each venv:
- Generate a shareable URL (e.g., `http://yourserver.com/live-logs/venv1`).
- When the user visits that link, it will subscribe them to the corresponding WebSocket channel (e.g., `ws://localhost:6789/venv1`).

### Conclusion:
- **Yes**, opening multiple WebSocket channels for each venv is a good idea.
- It lets users subscribe to specific venv logs, ensuring they only see the logs they’re interested in.
- **Shareable links** allow easy access to live logs, and users can monitor multiple venvs in real-time without being overwhelmed by all logs.

This approach scales well and gives users flexibility to monitor logs in a clean, organized manner.
